\section{Introduction}
Basic Formatting text in \LaTeX

\subsection{Text Formatting}

All the things you want to do,and do something should .. emphasis on SOMETIMES.

\textbf{Bold Formatting} is only between the curly braces

\emph{Italics Formatting}

\underline{Underline Formatting}

\subsection{Paragraph Formatting}

New Paragraph automatically indented.

\noindent But sometimes you don't wanna to indent to be.

\section{Oddities}

Strange things I noticed.

\subsection{Misquoting}

This is how I would normally type 'single'  and "double" quotes. Doesn't look odd?

\noindent Use the \emph{other} quote key you're probably never used before to make it better.

\noindent See my new `single' and ``double''? Ahh it's better.

\section{Conclusion}

These are just a few of the basic elements in a \LaTeX file.
