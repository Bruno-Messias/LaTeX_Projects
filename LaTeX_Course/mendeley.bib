abstract = {Through a series of recent breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This practical book shows you how. Using concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python frameworks—scikit-learn and TensorFlow—author Aur{\'{e}}lien G{\'{e}}ron helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You'll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks.},

abstract = {Background. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of anti-Gal Abs and non-anti-Gal Abs in hyperacute rejection (HAR) of concordant pancreas xenografts compared with heart xenografts. In addition, we tested whether rejection of Lewis rat pancreas grafts was T-cell dependent and could be prevented by anti-T-cell treatment. Methods. To determine the role of anti-Gal Abs in the induction of HAR, Lewis rat pancreas and heart xenografts were transplanted into $\alpha$1,3-Galactosyltransferase knockout (GT-Ko) mice treated with normal human serum (NHS) or hyperimmune serum, or into presensitized GT-Ko mice. To investigate whether rejection of pancreas xenograft was mediated by a T-cell dependent response, Lewis rat pancreas grafts were transplanted into streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic GT-Ko mice treated with FK506, anti-CD4 mAbs (GKI.5), and thymectomy. Antidonor-specific IgM and IgG and anti-Gal Abs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Rejected and long-term surviving pancreas xenografts were assessed by functional (blood glucose) and histopathological examination. Results. HAR of Lewis rat pancreas xenografts could not be induced by NHS (0.4 ml), whereas NHS (0.2 ml) resulted in HAR of Lewis heart xenografts. Infusion of Lewis rat-specific hyperimmune serum (0.2 ml) resulted in HAR of Lewis rat pancreas xenografts. In addition, second Lewis rat pancreas grafts were hyperacutely rejected by presensitized GT-Ko mice. Immunohistochemical staining showed a low expression of Gal$\alpha$1,3Gal antigen in the endocrine tissue compared with that in the cardiac grafts. The levels of anti-Gal Abs in pancreas xenograft transplantation did not increase in GT-Ko mice after pancreas xenograft transplantation that was significantly increased after heart transplantation. FK506 treatment induced long-term survival of Lewis pancreas xenografts (mean survival time (MST) {\textgreater} 90 days). Anti-CD4 treatment delayed rejection of Lewis rat pancreas xenografts with MST of 34.3 days, whereas anti-CD4, in combination with thymectomy, synergistically prolonged survival of pancreas xenograft (MST=70.4 days). Conclusion. Pancreas xenograft is resistant to anti-Gal Abs-induced HAR but is susceptible to anti-donor specific Abs. Rejection of Lewis pancreas xenograft in STZ-induced, diabetic, GT-Ko mice is T-cell dependent.},

abstract = {Deforestation rates in South-East Asia are among the highest of any tropical region, with expansion of oil palm being one important factor. Despite this. few Studies have investigated the impact of oil palm expansion on the arthropod fauna. We report here the first study on the impact of forest conversion to oil palm on overall arthropod abundance, biomass and composition. We compared arthropod abundance and biomass. collected from epiphytic bird's nest ferns, the canopy, and leaf litter between primary forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. Epiphytes. canopy and litter all contained a lower abundance (epiphytes: 67.2{\%}, canopy: 2.3{\%} and litter: 77.1{\%} reduction) and biomass (epiphytes: 87.5{\%}, canopy: 37.9{\%}, and litter: 72.4{\%} reduction) of arthropods in oil palm compared with primary forest. However. not all orders of arthropods showed the same level of decline, with some groups having higher abundance and biomass in oil palm. resulting in an altered community composition in the epiphytes and canopy in oil palm compared with forest. Our results show that forest conversion to oil palm impacts detrimentally oil invertebrates in all compartments of the forest ecosystem},

@book{Nathan2012,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
